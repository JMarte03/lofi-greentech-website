# 🍃 Lofi - Green Tech Industrial Investment Landing Page

This project is a practice website built during my journey to learn **Tailwind CSS**. It represents a fictional green tech industrial investment company called **Lofi**, focusing on sustainability and clean energy innovation. 

The design inspiration for this project came from [Dipainhouse](https://www.dipainhouse.com/), with all design credits belonging to them.
