### Lofi - Green Tech Industrial Investment Website

It represents a fictional green tech industrial investment company called **Lofi**, focusing on sustainability and clean energy innovation. The design inspiration for this project came from [Dipainhouse](https://www.dipainhouse.com/), with all design credits belonging to them.
